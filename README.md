# KonnyakuGPT: More Accurate Anime Subtitling with Multimodal GPT

[日本語](README_translations/ja.md) [中文](README_translations/zh.md)

KonnyakuGPT is an AI-powered high-quality and easy-to-use subtitle generator,
primarily targeted for Japanese animes.

## Key Features

1. **Easy to use**: one function call and high quality subtitle file is generated from the video.
2. **High quality** (depends on your budget): With "medium" quality preset which costs about $4 per 20-minute video,
   KonnyakuGPT is able to correctly address 80% of video-special terms (character names, etc) and produce subtitles that form a logical story.
   **Subtitles generated by KonnyakuGPT allow audience with no knowledge about Japanese to watch Japanese animes and understand the plots without the need to guess what is going on.**
3. **Translation support**: KonnyakuGPT can create translated subtitles for any language.
4. **Pausing and resuming**: progress is saved periodically when generating subtitles.
   You can resume your progress even if on going subtitle generation process is accidentally killed.
5. **Configurable**: KonnyakuGPT works well even if your video has an unusual setup and contains video-specific special terms (e.g., character names), which is common in Japanese animes.
   As long as you input background information that depicts the background of the video and include special terms that may occur, KonnyakuGPT will infer the plot and create subtitles that make sense and address special terms correctly.

Here's a screenshot of an episode from the Japanese anime Chimpui, with translated subtitles generated from KonnyakuGPT:

KonnyakuGPT not only addressed and translated the character's name (Japanese: "エリ" / English: "Eri"/ Chinese: "惠理") correctly, but also identified a special object in the scene and inferred its functionality (there is an "imagination gun" in the scene which shoots special rays that inject particular thoughts into creatures, with its effects lasting for 24 hours).

## Sample Usage

To create subtitles with predefnied methods, just import the default subtitle generator,
input background information, and invoke the generator.

**KonnyakuGPT uses Open AI's API services; you must configure the API key before invoking the subtitle generator.**
The easiest way to do so is to set the environment variable "OPEN_AI_API_KEY" before running the Python script that generates subtitles.
E.g.:

```bash
# run this line if you are on a Unix-like OS
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
# run this line if you are on Windows
set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

python <a-script-that-invokes-KonnyakuGPT>
```

Here is an example script that generates subtitles for an episode in the anime Chimpui by Fujiko F. Fujio:

```Python
from pathlib import Path

from src.subtitle_generation import DefaultGenerator

generator = DefaultGenerator(quality_preset='medium')


generator.generate_subtitles(video_path=Path('/home/trent/Downloads/episode.mp4'),
                            output_path=Path('test.srt'),
                            video_background=\
"""The video consists of two episodes from the Japanese anime Chimpui.
The title of the first episode is "ワンダユウは占い師？"; the title of the second episode is "エリさまは美少女".
There is an introductory screen at the start of each episode, where the title of that episode is shouted out.

## Homage

This project is developed in memory of the famous Japanese comic writer, Hiroshi Fujimoto (藤本 弘), also known as Fujiko F. Fujio (藤子・F・不二雄).
The name "KonnyakoGPT" is inspired by "ほんやくコンニャク" ("Translation Gummy") from Doraemon, his most popular creation.
